A full stack phonebook using React for the frontend, and Node.js, Express.js, Morgan (middleware), nodemon, and MongoDB (Mongoose) for the backend. Deployed on Heroku.

Users can add numbers to the phonebook, delete numbers, and replace existing numbers. Data is stored in a MongoDB database.

Code has also been written for appropriate error handling. Appropriate notifications are displayed once a particular operation is completed.

This is the frontend.
